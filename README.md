I was looking for a way to view, manage, and update my growing collection of physical movies so I decided to build my own. 

<strong>Front-End</strong>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>AngularJS</li>
  <li>Bootstrap 4</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<strong>Back-End</strong>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>Node.js</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>PassportJS</li>
</ul>

Includes features to add, edit, delete, rate, and filter entries in a collection that is specific to each user.

Uses RESTful API calls and a CRUD database management system written by me.
